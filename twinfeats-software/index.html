            <h1>About Us</h1>
            <p>
                Twin brothers Kent and Kevin Smotherman founded TwinFeats Software in 1983 with a simple
                premise: Free software for a free world. From the beginnings on the Commodore 64 to today's Android apps,
                that vision has never waivered.

            <p>
                TwinFeats Software creates innovative custom web applications which will meet
                and exceed expectations. We will work with you to fully understand your needs, 
                but more than that- your data. Web applications are all about data, and without 
                deeply understanding the needs of your data, your web application will suffer.
            </p>
            <h2>Web Applications Huh?</h2>
            <p> 
                Web sites are static. The content they display doesn't change dynamically. A web
                application is a web site powered by ya database. Facebook is a great example of a web 
                application-the data shown varies by user and can change every single second.

            <h1>Applications</h1>
            <p>We've written so many applications in the last 35+ years that we have literally
                lost count! Applications like our FredomWare line of games for the Commodore 64
                are log gone, as are our productivity suite for GEOS and the C64 and Amiga.
            </p>
            <p>
                Ever use WebEX. GotoMeeting or Zoom teleconferencing software? We wrote our own back in the 90s 
                not just for conferencing, but online learning. Our Android applications range from custom games 
                to productivity tools. Web sites and web applications? We've done 'em by the dozens.
            </p>
            <p>As we like to say, if we can't do it at TwinFeats Software. its a hardware problem! </p>
